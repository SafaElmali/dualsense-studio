# DualSense Controller

An interactive PS5 DualSense recreation built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js. The model, textures, and Three.js modules are included locally; the controller works without an external CDN or a build step. Optional analytics loads from PostHog; blocking it does not affect the controller.

## Run locally

Serve the repository over HTTP rather than opening `index.html` directly. With Python 3 installed:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```

Open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Interactions

- Click or tap the buttons.
- Drag either analog stick; release to center. A short tap clicks L3 or R3.
- Hold a trigger and drag upward to vary its pressure.
- **Auto** follows your inputs: L2/R2 show a tilted rear view, L1/R1 show the shoulders, and face buttons or sticks show the front. Held triggers take priority so aiming and firing do not flip the camera back and forth. The last angle stays after release. All buttons glow soft yellow while pressed; trigger caps also light up, with live L2/R2 pressure labels in the automatic rear view.
- Drag the shell to rotate the controller; scroll to zoom. Dragging or choosing a fixed angle pauses Auto. Choose Auto to resume, or Reset to restore the front and Auto. Camera movement respects reduced-motion preferences.
- Choose Front, Angle, or Back, and switch between White, Midnight Black, and Cosmic Red finishes.
- Enable optional button sounds or connect a standard-mapped gamepad to mirror its inputs.

| Control | Keyboard |
| --- | --- |
| Left stick | W, A, S, D |
| Right stick | I, J, K, L |
| D-pad | Arrow keys |
| Triangle / Circle / Cross / Square | 4 / 2 / X / Z |
| L1 / R1 | Q / E |
| L2 / R2 | 1 / 3 |
| L3 / R3 | F / H |
| Home / Mute / Touchpad | Space / M / T |
| Create / Options | C / Escape |

Home toggles the simulated light bars. Microphone mute remains a visual simulation. A connected DualSense can produce real adaptive trigger resistance through the optional hardware controls below.

## Tests

Node.js 20 or newer is required for the tests. No dependency installation is needed.

```sh
npm test
```

Tests cover simultaneous input sources, trigger pressure, circular stick travel, input priority, and release on focus loss.

## Analytics

[Open the Visitors & Usage dashboard](https://us.posthog.com/project/594399/dashboard/2066186). It shows production traffic over the last 30 days; development test events are excluded.

[PostHog project](https://us.posthog.com/project/594399) tracks this demo with cookieless analytics, no identified person profiles, no session recordings, and no automatic click/keyboard capture. Do Not Track is respected. Unique visitors are estimates and cookieless identity resets daily.

Localhost traffic is disabled by default. For an explicit integration test open `http://localhost:5173/controller.html?analytics_test=1` in the original preview, or `http://localhost:8000/?analytics_test=1` here. Those events have `environment=development`; filter dashboards to `environment=production` for real traffic.

| Event | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `$pageview` | Page opened; includes referrer and campaign information |
| `controller_loaded` | 3D model successfully ready |
| `controller_interacted` | First meaningful interaction, once per page visit |
| `controller_feature_used` | Button, stick, rotate, zoom, view, finish, or sound; once per feature per visit |
| `controller_finish_selected` | Selected finish, once per color per visit |
| `controller_gamepad_connected` | Gamepad found, once per page visit; no device identifier captured |
| `controller_active_time` | Incremental `seconds` of estimated active use; stops after 5 seconds of inactivity or when hidden/unfocused |

A visit here means one page load. Sum `controller_active_time.seconds` for active time; count `controller_interacted` for engaged page visits or use unique users for estimated people. Do not treat total events as visitor counts. Tracking begins only after the updated files are deployed.

The public project token in `controller/analytics.js` only allows event ingestion; it cannot read analytics or manage the account. If you fork the project, replace it with your own token. Cookieless server hash mode must be enabled in PostHog project settings.

## Real adaptive triggers

In desktop Chrome or Edge, connect a Sony DualSense or DualSense Edge using USB or Bluetooth, then click **Enable trigger effects** and select it in the browser device picker. **Pistol** (default, previously Shooting) creates a crisp resistance wall and release. **Shotgun** has a heavier, longer pull before the break. Release to rearm either single-shot effect. **LMG** cycles strong trigger pulses at 10 Hz while held past the first third of travel. **SMG** uses lighter, faster pulses at 18 Hz. Release the physical trigger to stop the pulses. **Resistance** provides the original gentle, steady force. These are stylized presets, not replicas of real weapons or a specific game. You can switch effects while enabled; changing modes while Off leaves them off. Squeeze the physical L2/R2 triggers to feel it; the Gamepad API continues to mirror your inputs.

**Off**, **Reset**, opening Controls, and leaving the tab send the explicit Off effect. Returning to the tab requires enabling effects again. Closing the page attempts to release and close the device; abrupt browser termination cannot guarantee a final hardware message. Disconnect the controller if resistance persists.

Safari, Firefox, and browsers without WebHID keep the virtual controls but disable hardware effects. HTTPS or localhost is required. If Bluetooth is unavailable or another controller app has exclusive access, try a USB data cable and close that app.

The feature sends only adaptive-trigger output fields, with no audio, rumble, light, or microphone commands. It does not recreate a particular game's trigger patterns. Software checks cover packet encoding, Bluetooth CRC, unsupported devices, canceled selection, all gun presets and mode switching, concurrent Off, failed writes, and disconnect cleanup. Physical hardware feel requires manual verification.

Protocol references and the adapted trigger encoder's license are in [controller/TRIGGER-NOTICES.md](controller/TRIGGER-NOTICES.md).

## Touchpad finger tracking

Choose **Enable touchpad** in desktop Chrome or Edge and select your DualSense. This shares the hardware connection with adaptive triggers and does not enable trigger effects. USB and full Bluetooth reports carry up to two finger positions; the app draws a yellow circle for each contact without requiring a touchpad click. Moving or lifting a finger updates or removes its circle. You can also drag the on-screen touchpad. No vibration is added.

Auto brings the touchpad into view when touched (held triggers retain camera priority). Finger circles clear on focus loss, Reset, and disconnect. Bluetooth tracking requests the extended input report via feature report 0x05; try USB if your browser/controller cannot provide it. Normal Gamepad API input alone cannot provide finger positions. Touch coordinates stay in the browser and are not sent to analytics.

## Target practice

Choose **Play target practice** beneath the page title to open a 45-second arcade round. Three moving bullseyes respawn after hits. Center hits score 100, outer hits score 50, and consecutive hits add a bonus up to 50 per hit. The HUD shows score, time, accuracy, streak, and a personal best stored only in your browser.

- **Controller:** right stick aims, R2 fires, Triangle cycles weapons, and Cross starts/replays/resumes a round.
- **Mouse:** aim and click; hold for automatic weapons. **Touchscreen:** tap targets.
- **Keyboard:** WASD or arrows aim, Space fires, and 1–4 select Pistol, Shotgun, LMG, or SMG.
- Pistol and Shotgun require release between shots. Shotgun has a wider hit area; LMG and SMG fire continuously at their preset cadence. Release R2 after switching weapons to rearm.
- Enable adaptive triggers before starting or while paused to feel the selected preset. Playing itself needs no hardware permission. The range uses the existing trigger connection and changes both L2/R2 to the chosen preset without adding rumble or touchpad vibration.
- Pause, losing focus, hiding the tab, finishing, and closing the range stop firing and release trigger effects. Resume preserves the score and timer, but hardware effects must be enabled again. Closing restores the interactive 3D controller.

The range uses a separate Canvas 2D renderer and suspends the 3D render while open. Tests cover target collision/scoring, cooldowns, automatic-fire cadence, single-shot rearming, pause/resume, round completion, and aiming bounds.

## Touchpad drawing

Open **Touchpad drawing** below the hardware controls. Move one or two fingers on an enabled physical touchpad, or drag across the canvas with a mouse or touchscreen. Choose soft gold, ice blue, or lilac; lifting a finger starts a separate stroke. **Save drawing** exports a 1200 × 735 PNG with a small studio footer. **Clear canvas** starts over. Closing the panel preserves the drawing in memory; refreshing clears it. The canvas caps recorded points at 20,000 and announces when it is full. Drawing adds no vibration and sends no coordinates or artwork to a server.

## Custom trigger presets

Expand **Customize & share this preset** under **Feel the triggers**. Strength runs from 1 to 8. LMG and SMG also support pulse speeds from 1 to 30 Hz; single-shot and steady-resistance modes do not use a pulse speed. Slider changes apply when released, using the existing serialized hardware writes. **Reset preset** restores the selected mode's defaults. Changing the mode also restores its defaults.

**Copy preset link** puts the mode, strength, and speed in the URL fragment. A visible link is provided if clipboard access is unavailable. Loading a link validates all settings and never requests controller access or enables effects. The recipient must choose **Enable trigger effects**. Customization while Off stays off. Target practice selects each weapon's default physical preset to keep its established firing cadence.

## Controller diagnostics

Open **Controller diagnostics**, connect a gamepad, and press a button if the browser has not detected it. The panel displays the first four raw stick axes without the 3D viewer's added deadzone. **Measure resting sticks** samples for two seconds and reports the mean offset from center plus the greatest offset seen. Let go of the sticks during this measurement. Focus loss cancels an incomplete measurement.

For a standard-mapped controller, L2 and R2 show current travel and observed minimum/maximum values. Each button shows its current press/release state and press count. **Reset readings**, reconnecting, or opening the panel starts a new check. These are browser-reported readings, not a hardware calibration, fault diagnosis, or end-to-end latency test. Opening diagnostics releases adaptive trigger effects.

## Shareable scorecards

Finish a target-practice round, then choose **Download scorecard**. The 1200 × 675 PNG includes the score, accuracy, hits/shots, and every weapon actually fired during that round. Switching weapons after completion cannot change the card, and replay cannot change a download already started. Empty rounds explicitly say no shots were fired. Cards are generated locally; there is no account, upload, or public leaderboard.

### Studio feature analytics

The new tools send explicit PostHog events through the same cookieless client and development/production filters. `controller_feature_used` counts each feature once per page visit: `touchpad_drawing`, `trigger_presets`, `diagnostics`, `scorecard`, and `target_practice`. For feature reach, count unique visitors or feature-used events; action events below can repeat in one visit.

| Events | Meaning and properties |
| --- | --- |
| `controller_touchpad_drawing_opened`, `_started`, `_cleared`, `_exported`, `_export_failed` | Panel opens, first drawing input, clears, successful PNG generation/download requests, and failed exports. `_started` is once per input source per page visit, with `input_source=hardware` or `pointer`. |
| `controller_trigger_presets_opened`, `_changed`, `_reset` | Editor opened by the user, committed mode/slider changes, or defaults restored. Changes include `mode`, `strength`, and `speed_hz`; resets include `mode`. Slider movement does not send a per-frame stream. |
| `controller_trigger_presets_link_created`, `_link_copied`, `_loaded` | Link prepared, successfully copied through the clipboard API or manual copy action, and valid shared preset loaded. Custom properties are `mode`, `strength`, and `speed_hz`. Loading alone does not count as an engaged visit. |
| `controller_diagnostics_opened`, `_connected`, `_measurement_started`, `_measurement_completed`, `_reset` | Panel use and two-second resting measurements. Connection is counted once per page visit. Canceled measurements do not emit completion. No raw readings or device identifiers are included. |
| `controller_target_practice_started`, `_completed` | New rounds (resuming does not count as a start), with starting `mode`; completion includes `score`, `hits`, `shots`, `accuracy`, and `weapons`. |
| `controller_scorecard_exported`, `_export_failed` | Scorecard PNG generated and download requested, or export failure. Success includes the completed round's `score`, `hits`, `shots`, `accuracy`, and `weapons`. |

In this table, each underscored suffix continues the full event prefix in its row. An export event confirms PNG generation and a browser download request; it cannot confirm that the user saved the file to disk or posted it elsewhere. Custom properties use an allowlist; the existing PostHog client also attaches standard page/browser metadata. No artwork, touch coordinates, stick/trigger readings, controller IDs, or raw error messages are sent. Blocked analytics never interrupts the tools.

To verify in PostHog, open **Activity → Events**, filter event names by the prefixes above, and filter `app=dualsense-controller` plus `environment=production`. For development checks use `?analytics_test=1` on localhost and `environment=development`; these are excluded from the production dashboard.
